> :warning: **Note**: This project is using modules that are being phased out
in Reactor 3.x, most notably reactor-bus. If you have questions about Reactor 3, join the
community (see the [reactor-core README](https://github.com/reactor/reactor/blob/master/README.md)).

You can practice more Reactor with tutorials found in the [Learn Section](https://projectreactor.io/learn), [Spring+Reactor workshop](https://github.com/reactor/head-first-reactive-with-spring-and-reactor) and [Lite Rx Hands-On](https://github.com/reactor/lite-rx-api-hands-on).
